# SwiftStarter
A Swift iOS-development starter kit 

An opinionated development kit basing on the frameworks that are great on their own, 
and they are greater together.


### Usage

Clone the project, use it as a template. Change project name and you are good to go.

### Battery included 

* PureLayout
* SwiftyJSON
* Alamofire
* Siesta
* Nimble

Note that all except Nimble are included via Carthage, where Nimble are added as a git submodule.

### Siesta setup

Siesta is great, but it requires additional efforts to set it up, which motivates this repo in first place.

This kit/template sets up all required steps for you to just jump in and use.

The organization and setup are based on my experience of using it in production so far.

### SwiftLayout option

You may integrate my other repo SwiftLayout in this, to have a very enjoyable Swift development experience.
