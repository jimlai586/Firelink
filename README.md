# Firelink

> Very well.
Then touch the darkness within me.
Take nourishment from these sovereignless souls.

A showcase of development flow.

An experimental ground to try new ideas.

It also serves as a template to quickly get environment up and running.

### Battery included 

* PureLayout
* SwiftyJSON
* Alamofire
* Siesta
* Nimble
* Fastlane

### Why Siesta

Compared to Alamofire, Siesta is less known. There are also other similar frameworks like Maya.

So why choose it? 

In fact I have all my projects, in company or otherwise built around it. 

**When you refactor Alamofire, you get Siesta**

I realized this, when I ... you've guessed it, refactored Alamofre.

### 1 + 1 > 2

This happens when you add Siesta and SwiftyJSON together. 

You need to do some extension and add helper functions of course. 

But the result... 

**My team chose it as de facto standard library to be used in all projects onwards

### FRP done right

It currently contains an example that compares this flow to RxSwift.

[You can read more about in my medium article](https://medium.com/@swift2931/why-rxswift-may-not-be-the-solution-you-are-looking-for-705fafdae6a2)

### RxSwift = RxJava + KVO

**Repeat after me. Static Dispatch**

Observable is type-erased bullshit based on false premesis that everyhing is a stream. 

**It is NOT. Even when I write live streaming code, I use callback with concrete type.**
